<h1>Welcome to Aaron's Everett Music Dojo</h1>

<p>Here is the Dojo, we are going to develop our 
musical skills in a unique way. We are going to
 learn the art of music composition Aaron's way.
In order to compose music you have to draw some
 dots on a piece of manuscript paper. Then you have
to play those dots.
</p><p>
The job of the musician I believe is to generate a 
stream of music from nothing, to write it down, and
to practice what they write. Now if you feel you are
incapable of producing a musical idea, you are in 
luck. Aaron has already thought of thus. He has 
devised a revolutionary system whereby utterly 
non-musical people can begin creating a stream of
melodic and chordal content.
</p><p>
The system is called the Dull Musical System or DMS.
