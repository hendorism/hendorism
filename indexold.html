<h3>I just sang the finale of Beethoven's ninth symphony with 300 singers and orchestra.</h3>
<p>
  The fourth and final movement of this symphony is a long one. It features a quartet of vocal soloists,
  one soprano, one alto, one tenor, and one bass. They were incredible. The alto soloist was Jen Rogers,
  who is the artistic director of the Everett Chorale which is the group I sing in. On my left and right 
  were two fellow Everett Chorale basses, and behind me were some tenors. I could tell this not by their 
  name or face, but by the high notes they were singing. There were some high notes indeed. The whole thing 
  is on a high note. It features the lyrics of a drinking song, but the composer removed drinking references.
  He was already experiencing deafness as he composed it and at the first performance. The performance was 
  a mediocre success and had bad reviews. The second performance didn't even cover expenses.
</p>
<p>
  Regarding the high notes though, the thing features a piccolo (as well as the low contrabassoon). Our 
  soprano soloist was asked to sing B5, that note that sit atop a ledger line over the treble cleff, the 
  19th fret on the high E string of your guitar. This is 987hz, an octave above the highest note I can 
  possibly screech. God bless her and her voice and the preperation she has undergone to be able to pull 
  off those lines. But we in the bass section did heroically 
  sing F4 (349hz) which sits on the first space of the 
  treble cleff or the 5th line of the tenor cleff, or for us in our bass cleff it sits atop two ledger 
  lines. It's found on the 2nd fret of your guitar's high E string. 
  And this is Beethoven two hundred years ago singing about the joy of mankind being sustained 
  by the benevolence of God so of course it must be sung with a full chest voice as if you are calling
  to your friend in battle that the enemy is vanquished. We were not, as basses, called upon to sing 
  exceptionally low notes. I think the lowest we went was G2 (98hz) 33.333% higher than my lowest note 
  D2 (73.4hz) (which I cannot sing on a normal day). G2 is about the lowest I can reliably go on any 
  day rain or shine, but usually I can reach F2 or E2.

    <h3>Here is a composition of mine:</h3>
    <p class="contentDivMoreP">This
 one I composed in December 2019
       I think. It is in the
 key of Db major because 
      I wanted to get better 
at playing in that key.
      I have always had a
 hard time with the Db major 
scale. It is quite tricky 
on the clarinet.
      It is one half step 
above the C scale which is the 
easiest scale because it uses 
      all the easy fingerings. 
All the Db major fingerings are 
      between all the C fingerings 
with the exception of two of 
      the seven notes. Those are 
the two common tones between C 
      and Db. They are C and F. 
Besides C and F, just about 
      every note in the Db major 
scale uses one 
      or more of the pinky levers 
and trill keys.
    </p>
<p class="contentDivMoreP">Of 
course I don't like to confine 
myself to the realm of the major scale.
  I like to involve chromatic notes, 
and with a scale that employs five 
of the seven available flats one
 could throw in a key signature, 
we are bound to encounter some
 DOUBLE-FLATS!. Now these are not
  a big scary thing. The double-flat
 notes I use in this are best thought
 of in terms of their
  Nashville Number System number.
 For example, in measure number 3 
we encounter the first one, Bbb. B
 is the 6 of D. so Bb is the 6 of Db,
 so Bbb is the flat 6 of Db. the 6
 of a major scale is a major 6th
 above the root, and Bbb is a minor
 6th above Db. So I would call it a 
minor 6 or a flat 6.
</p>
 
<p class="contentDivMoreP">Later
 I see Abb, the flat 5 of Db
 since A is the five of D, Ab 
is the five of Db, so Abb is the 
flat five of Db.</p>

<div class="parenthetical">
  <p>Here is a natural sign written above a note and put in parenthesis. This is interesting to me because sometimes in writing scores by hand and using a pen I find I want to add an accidental after I have written a phrase so densely that there is no room. Always concerned with best practices I sometimes worry I'm committing some sin by doing just this, adding an accidental, redundant or not, above the note. Seeing this is reassuring. I am not in the habit of suing parenthesis in these events, but I will probbaly use them now.</p>
  <p>Sometimes I will place the accidental off to the left in a way that is pretty ambiguous to someone who is not used to reading my hand-engraved scores. To me the chain of deduction to determine which note the accidental is referring to is obvious, and part of the reason I do so much work by hand is because I believe it grows my reading ability to new levels and that my ease in deducing my own intent is not solely because of my familiarity with my own hand-engraving practices.</p>
  <p>This is from Vivaldi's Four Seasons "Summer" Concerto in G minor found <a href="https://imslp.org/wiki/Le_quattro_stagioni_(Vivaldi%2C_Antonio)">here</a>. Please donate to imslp.org because they provide the world with so much important information. Because of them I've been able to freely and conveniently access scores of Beethoven, Brahms, Mozart, Teleman, etc. My local Library has none of this stuff. I would have to go to Bellevue or the University of Washington to get access to these scores and check out bulky physical copies for short periods. imslp.org allows me to study these things at my leisure and at a moment's notice even from the convenience of my phone while I am on a break at work.</p>
