      <br>Aaron's music dojo is a place where you can go to hone your music skills.
    There are many challenges there. You will learn how to read music.
    You will learn to write music. You will learn how to write down the music you
    hear in your head or on the radio or in your dreams. In doing this you will have
    artistically brought a very authentic part of yourself out into the world
    in sharrper focus than before, and you have added value to society.
    This is the basic value proposition of music. It's all about bein' real.</p>

    Innovations Studio is my Wordpress site. It is full of links and pictures and little blog posts
      about music events I attend or participate in.
    I made this site so I could have a site to post music and blog posts, but I quickly became displeased
    with the way the site builder works.
    So I started this github page as soon as I discovered that github will host a live url for free.
      very soon I will spend the money to get a real website.
    It is probably good that I am taking my time in getting a website.
    In the mean time I am doing all I can to learn html and css and javascript.
    I briefly started with python and learned some basic stuff, but I my toshiba laptop got a virus and my
      Asus laptop's hard drive went kaputt.</p></div>
