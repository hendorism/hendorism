Dear Hiring Manager,

For two years now I have been studying HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Ruby on
Rails, React, jQuery, Firebase, Bootstrap. Prior to that I've worked in a
fishing ship in Alaska, and at a debarker mill in Everett. I've loved my
career - the people, the feeling of satisfaction. But I don't think there's a
future in it. My coworkers struggle with health issues and based on my own
background in teaching and composing music, I would prefer a job that was more
intellectually stimulating.

Thanks to the encouragement of my friends who are developers and have built
great careers, I'm ready to take a chance and build a better future for myself.

I have a two websites, a social media presence of sorts, code projects stored in
codepen, github and AWS; a music notation app, a simulator app for the
log-debarker machine I ran in the sawmill for two years, and other code
projects. I have been following curriculums on various websites as well as
participation in Zoom classes run by a friend who works with Ruby on Rails.

Thank you for reading, and I hope you will consider me for the position!

Sincerely,
Aaron Dull
