      <h3>Alright! this is my blog.</h3>
<p>This is the front page of my blog. Oh gosh I need help here. I am not a web designer, but I would be happy to become one.  am working day after to day to improve my relationship with computers. I have always loved computers, but I want to take our relationship to the next level. I want to be married to computers. I want them to be my sugar-mamma! All joking aiaside, I am going to become some kind of high wage earner before I am 35... I mean I already gross like 50k at least I think. I will have to consult my spreadsheets to confirm that.
</p><br>
<p>
    Well by now you know a little bit about. me I have a big head and I like to talk abeout myself. I have created this website to share my genius with the world (pun intended) and do it from the comfort of my own home instead of in the library in the company of noisty smelly people.
</p><br>
<p>
    And one of the things I think the hompage will be lost without: an svg element:
</p><br>
<svg width="1200" height="750" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <line x1="10" y1="30" x2="1190" y2="30" style="stroke:#000;stroke-width:2" />
    <line x1="10" y1="40" x2="1190" y2="40" style="stroke:#000;stroke-width:2" />
    <line x1="10" y1="50" x2="1190" y2="50" style="stroke:#000;stroke-width:2" />
    <line x1="10" y1="60" x2="1190" y2="60" style="stroke:#000;stroke-width:2" />
    <line x1="10" y1="70" x2="1190" y2="70" style="stroke:#000;stroke-width:2" />
</svg>
