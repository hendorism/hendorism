<h3>august 8 2019</h3>
<p>Today I put a different CD in on the way home from work. The one I had in before that was country favorites from 1961. The new one is country hymns, mostly sacred gospel country type stuff.</p>

    Going to send back my macbook air that I ordered. I have had it for like two weeks I think, and I have noticed some things I do not like. THe seller had mostly positive reviews but some negative ones having to do with defective machine being sent out. Mine says the battery needs to be replaced soon. It seems to drain fast. I also noticed it was pretty warm when I was sitting with it in my lap. I don't see any cooling fan inlets and I don't hear any fans.

    </p>

    <p>
        When I get off work tomorrow I'm gonna go and put it in a bod and send it off after I wipe all my stuff off which should take only a few minutes. I don't have much stuff on here. Most of the stuf I did put on was applications I downloaded. These include but are not limited to: Starcraft, Musescore, Garage Band, and others.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I do think it is about time for me to start being a more savvy consumer and returning things that aren't really what I need, spending more time out and about shopping and pricing and checking things out. I need to get a reslly nice laptop.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yesterday when I was looking at some laptops to replace this macbook air that I am sitting with and using right now, I looked at a macbook pro 2015 with i7 and 8gb ram for $1,100. This was a certified refurbished machine like the one I have here. The one I have is a 2013 MacBook air with an i5 and 4gb ram.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the very least I think if I had to pick one of those specs to upgrade and leave everything else the same I would get the same MacBook Air with 8gb ram. This is because I watched a comparison video of some gaming with an i5 and an i7, and the difference was noticeable. The i7 was smooth and near perfect. The i5 was smooth and near perfect most of the time but one time froze for a whole half second, and frequently would lag ever so slightly
    </p>
    <p>
        I know I need to acquie this tool now more than ever because having this MacBook Air has awakened me. These are very powerful machines. I have lots of work to do in garage band, ableton, imovie, and many others. I just started using brackets do to html and javascript and other coding, and I figured out how to use the live update feature so every time I hit save it auto reloads in a browser which I have filling one half of my screen. It is so great.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the same time I have just started using github. Mark made me make a github account like a couple montsh ago, but I had not touched it for a while because I didn't totally understand it. That at my grandpa's funeral my cousin told me you can post a static .html document for free on github. So now for the first time in my life I have accessible on the internet pages which I have composed from scratch using html, css, and javascript.
    </p>
    <p>
        This has been the result of my 10 year effort to become a computer programmer. This started about a year ago I think in the Summer of 2018... I was talking to my programmer friend who I will call "Digital Danny".
    </p>
    <p>
        This patragraph is being composed within the window on github.com. I am doing this to commensurate the beginning of my coding career. I am maintaining this pointless blog just to get my feet wet. I am interning for myself. Working for free, getting a whole lot of nothing done. This page will be a timeless relic for ages and ages to come. This page will survive throught the next world war and the dark ages and the next ice age etc.

        <h3>8/2/2019 - Friday</h3>
        <p>Today is Friday, and that is the day we quit working and go live life for a couple days.</p>
        <p>I need to play the clarinet some more to get my chops all wrapped around this new synthetic reed I bought. I may have to go back and buy the same reed but in a higher strength. The reed I got was a Legere 2.5 I think. It was around $28, and should last for a long time. The tone gets kind of lame when I try to play loud. LIke when I really try to make the clarinet wail it comes out like nothing good. But when I ease off the thing a little bit I can get an ok tone out of it.</p>
        <p>The thing is maybe soon I should take my Buffet clarinet back in to have it looked at by the same guy I took it to last time. Last time I took it to a guy in Lake Stevens who was reccommended to me by my flute teacher and another one of her friends. He was really nice and showed me his home workshop and taught me some things about my instruments. I told him I had been interested in the instrument repair program at Renton Technical College, and he said that he had trained one of the guys there or something like that.</p>
        <p>But as far as schooling goes, my sights are currently set on a music therapy degree at Seattle University on Capitol Hill.</p>

                <h2>7/31/2019 part A - Wednesday - part A</h2>
                <p>This is the real Wednesday post. The rest of the post was created the day before so is not actually the actual wednesday post but in fact the tuesday post. We are gonna continue to shake things up here as we continue here today.
                  <br><br>
                  I understand the best way to shake yourself out of a musical depression is to pick up the instrument and play the longest long tone you can possibly play until you are totally out of breach. Then on your next breath, play another big long tone as long as you can!. Do not hyperventilate!
                  <br><br>
                  I think that when you play your scales you sometimes ought to do the following:
                  <br><br>
                  experiment with misplacing half and whole steps. coming pu with some minor thirds and augmented intervals is ok. This will lead to many interesting modulations. Experiment with some randomness. I think that if you want to be the best, you have to beat the rest. you have got to play all your scales in rapid succession. i do this by playing on clarinet the E scale from low E up an octave and then immediately the F scale up the same octave.
                </p>
                <p>Here I am really getting serious. I am upping my word count. I am saying things that matter. I am on my way to delivering so much value that the whole world will be gushing with riches from head to toe. Every pauper will be bursting with cash. Every housewife will buy a casino and profit enormously. Every man, woman, and child on the earth or any other planets will find a trillion dollar bill in their pocket. I am talking about some serious stuff here. What I mean is that one day when my ship comes in I'm goin to be gone with the wind and such.</p>

                <p>Another thing I need to say is that i have completely run out of things to say otday, but I realise that I am going to be the next dori monson. and how can i be the next dori monson if i dont write ten thousand words per day? I need to realise that it is time to produce. I need to produce music, I need to produce lots of writing, I need to continue to prudce videos. I need to produce courses. I needd to write a manifesto on my music philosophy... tht is if I have enough philosophy to fill a manifesto...</p>

            <p>I am starting the blog post for this day early the night 
            before because I am simply so excited about my new outlet. This 
            is my new trumpet unto the world, and I have to realise that 
            there may be people reading this right now even as I type. 
            That's right even the government could be reading this, and you 
            know it is important what the government thinks of your 
            creative work because that government has kind of a moral 
            authority over the people who are governed by it...</p>

            <p>I'm just saying a bunch of weird stuff to fill in the space, 
            but now I'll talk about somethin worth while...</p>

            <p>I am a musician. And that is going to be what this blog is 
            about... my music, my musical aspirations, my musical friends 
            and my musical experiences that I have with my musical friends. 
            I don't want to be a big obessor or nothin' but...</p>

            <p>Something happened a while ago when I realized that everyone 
            and their mom is on social media and the thing is I can't just 
            talk like I used to and say funn raondom stuff about stupid 
            things because there are just too many angles to watch your 
            butt when everyone is watching.</p>

            <p>But now I have this, my own personal little bit of server 
            space somewhere on the internet that is not art of someone 
            else's social media platform. Although what really is the 
            difference between github and a social media platform?</p>

            <p>Here at the end I would like to add a message of peace. I want you to go into your home at the end of the day feeling very peaceful indeed, and not lacking in food or any other thing you need. I want you to know that there are people who care for you and want you to do well. There are people that will feed you an provide for you in your time of distress and inability. I want you to understand and to know that this world will never truly leave you behind...</p>

            <p>That is about the cheesiest and strangest thing I cn think of to write. the time is now late in the evening and I amd going to pay tomorrow in misery if I don't get to bed soon.</p>

            <p>I am learning about Javascript in a podcast. Javascript came out in 1995 with a version of Netscape. There were some old pros looking down their noses as Javascript, but Brandon the creator snuck in some other serious concepts from other languages so that Javascript could do almost anything in computer science. If you want to make a browser app with interactive elements... Regardless of what kind of programmer you are, Javascript is the one language that all need to learn. Netscape disapeared and Internet Explorer took over, but Javascript was to live on.</p>

            <p>Micheal clayton: 2004 gmail released. Now you can work straight from your inbox and stay on that page while you go through emails. This saved a bunch of time and energy. It changes a web developer's role to just a thin layer away from the user. Javascript is responsible for web 2.0.</p>

            <p>JS is now working on servers with Node.js. There are a lot of people who write JS for browser, and now with Node.js you can program servers to run js on servers.</p>

        <div><!-- first blog post -->
            <h2>7/30/2019</h2>

            <p>This is the first blog post. I will be working on this log 
            everywhere. This is my blog, my manifesto to the world. It is 
            my litle corner of the internet so I don't have to worry about 
            what it will look like on social media. I mean I intend for 
            everyone to read this, but it's just better.</p>

            <p>I even have a wordpress site: 
            innovationsstudio.wordpress.com which is totally dumb. I mean 
            the blog content which it contains is ery cool and I would 
            eventually like to transfer those blog posts to my new and 
            better blog just to preserve their history, but for now I will 
            just commence to maintaining this blog and using it to post 
            about all my musical adventures and other thoughts on business 
            and life nd of course little blurbs about my youtube videos. I 
            feel like I'm twelve years old again and I am black in the wild 
            west days of the internet long before myspace. This is back in 
            the days of poer PC's before I ever saw an iMac in school or 
            anywhere, back in the days when I owned a Macintosh IIVX with a 
            76MB hard drive running Mac OS 7.6</p>

            <p>THis is relevant becuse I am a guy of mixed passions. I want 
            to be a computer whiz and create a program that will mind 
            control everyone to sit down and read a self-help book, but I 
            also like my current job which is moving logs around in a big 
            mill that cuts big boards.</p>

            <p>And so I think I will wrap up this blog post by saying... I 
            do not know what I will say and now I am just having fun typing 
            for the sheer pleasure of the tactile whatever.</p>

            <p>In all honesty though it would be so cool to eventually be a 
            blogger or some kind of digital nomad. I certainly am saving up 
            about 20% of my income right now for the past few years. This 
            is being invested and I seem to be getting good returns, but I 
            am realising now that I have a 401K just how much I have been 
            missing out on just because of 401k contributions being tax-
            free. I could have started a 401k when I was 18 years old. I 
            would probably have $100k or more by now if I had started that 
            then and saved 10% of my income.</p>
