<h2>7/31/2019 - Wednesday - second post</h2>

<p>I am starting the blog post for this day early the night 

before because I am simply so excited about my new outlet. This 

is my new trumpet unto the world, and I have to realise that 

there may be people reading this right now even as I type. 

That's right even the government could be reading this, and you 

know it is important what the government thinks of your 

creative work because that government has kind of a moral 

authority over the people who are governed by it...</p>

<p>I'm just saying a bunch of weird stuff to fill in the space, 

but now I'll talk about somethin worth while...</p>

<p>I am a musician. And that is going to be what this blog is 

about... my music, my musical aspirations, my musical friends 

and my musical experiences that I have with my musical friends. 

I don't want to be a big obessor or nothin' but...</p>

<p>Something happened a while ago when I realized that everyone 

and their mom is on social media and the thing is I can't just 

talk like I used to and say funn raondom stuff about stupid 

things because there are just too many angles to watch your 

butt when everyone is watching.</p>

<p>But now I have this, my own personal little bit of server 

space somewhere on the internet that is not art of someone 

else's social media platform. Although what really is the 

difference between github and a social media platform?</p>
  <p>Here at the end I would like to add a message of peace. I want you to go into your home at the end of the day feeling very peaceful indeed, and not lacking in food or any other thing you need. I want you to know that there are people who care for you and want you to do well. There are people that will feed you an provide for you in your time of distress and inability. I want you to understand and to know that this world will never truly leave you behind...</p>
  <p>That is about the cheesiest and strangest thing I cn think of to write. the time is now late in the evening and I amd going to pay tomorrow in misery if I don't get to bed soon.</p>

<p>I am learning about Javascript in a podcast. Javascript came out in 1995 with a version of Netscape. There were some old pros looking down their noses as Javascript, but Brandon the creator snuck in some other serious concepts from other languages so that Javascript could do almost anything in computer science. If you want to make a browser app with interactive elements... Regardless of what kind of programmer you are, Javascript is the one language that all need to learn. Netscape disapeared and Internet Explorer took over, but Javascript was to live on.</p>

<p>Micheal clayton: 2004 gmail released. Now you can work straight from your inbox and stay on that page while you go through emails. This saved a bunch of time and energy. It changes a web developer's role to just a thin layer away from the user. Javascript is responsible for web 2.0.</p>

<p>JS is now working on servers with Node.js. There are a lot of people who write JS for browser, and now with Node.js you can program servers to run js on servers.</p>

<h2>7/30/2019</h2>
<p>This is the first blog post. I will be working on this log 

everywhere. This is my blog, my manifesto to the world. It is 

my litle corner of the internet so I don't have to worry about 

what it will look like on social media. I mean I intend for 

everyone to read this, but it's just better.</p>
<p>I even have a wordpress site: 

innovationsstudio.wordpress.com which is totally dumb. I mean 

the blog content which it contains is ery cool and I would 

eventually like to transfer those blog posts to my new and 

better blog just to preserve their history, but for now I will 

just commence to maintaining this blog and using it to post 

about all my musical adventures and other thoughts on business 

and life nd of course little blurbs about my youtube videos. I 

feel like I'm twelve years old again and I am black in the wild 

west days of the internet long before myspace. This is back in 

the days of poer PC's before I ever saw an iMac in school or 

anywhere, back in the days when I owned a Macintosh IIVX with a 

76MB hard drive running Mac OS 7.6</p>
<p>THis is relevant becuse I am a guy of mixed passions. I want 

to be a computer whiz and create a program that will mind 

control everyone to sit down and read a self-help book, but I 

also like my current job which is moving logs around in a big 

mill that cuts big boards.</p>
<p>And so I think I will wrap up this blog post by saying... I 

do not know what I will say and now I am just having fun typing 

for the sheer pleasure of the tactile whatever.</p>

<p>In all honesty though it would be so cool to eventually be a 

blogger or some kind of digital nomad. I certainly am saving up 

about 20% of my income right now for the past few years. This 

is being invested and I seem to be getting good returns, but I 

am realising now that I have a 401K just how much I have been 

missing out on just because of 401k contributions being tax-

free. I could have started a 401k when I was 18 years old. I 

would probably have $100k or more by now if I had started that 

then and saved 10% of my income.</p>
