    <p>You have entered into a dark dungeon. There are sounds all around you,
    but everything is dim. The door creaks shut behind you and you hear a click.
You try the door and find that it will not budge. You have been
plunged into utter blackness. Not being of a timid nature,
you begin to blindly explore your surroundings.</p>
